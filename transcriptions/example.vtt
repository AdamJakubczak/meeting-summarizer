00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. Let’s dive straight in. Rafał, can you kick us off with the latest sales figures?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/2-0
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
<v Rafał Szelc>Morning, Adam. The Q3 numbers are looking strong. We've exceeded our targets by 15% for the enterprise segment.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/3-0
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Anna Kowalska>That’s excellent news! What's the main driver behind that growth, Rafał?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/4-0
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Rafał Szelc>It's primarily due to the new client acquisition campaign we launched last quarter. The outreach seems to have paid off.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/5-0
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>And how does that translate to revenue? Are we seeing a similar uptick there, Rafał?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/6-0
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Yes, Magda. Revenue is up 12% year-over-year. We're on track to hit our annual goal if this trend continues.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/7-0
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>From a technical standpoint, are we prepared for this increased demand? I’m concerned about server load.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/8-0
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>That’s a fair point, Tomasz. Let’s put that on the agenda for a deeper discussion. Anna, what's next for marketing?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/9-0
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Anna Kowalska>We're planning to leverage the sales data to refine our target audience for the next campaign. We want to focus on industries where we've seen the most success.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/10-0
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Rafał Szelc>I can provide you with a detailed breakdown of that data, Anna. Just let me know what you need.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/11-0
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>Speaking of the campaign, Anna, what's the proposed budget? I need to get an early look at the numbers.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/12-0
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'll be sending over the full proposal this afternoon. We're budgeting for a 20% increase to cover digital advertising costs.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/13-0
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Just a quick note on that budget, if we're increasing ad spend, we'll need to make sure our landing pages can handle the traffic. I'd suggest a technical audit.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/14-0
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Good idea, Tomasz. Let's schedule a separate meeting for that next week. Magda, anything else we need to cover on the financial side?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07256e2fe/15-0
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'd like to review the operational expenses for Q3. There's been a slight increase in our software subscription costs.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/16-0
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>That's likely due to the new licenses we had to purchase for the development team. We needed them to work on the new product.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/17-0
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Understood. We'll need to account for that in the Q4 budget. We can discuss the details offline.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/18-0
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Sounds good. So, just to recap, we've got a follow-up meeting to address the technical audit for landing pages. Anna will send over the marketing budget proposal this afternoon.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/19-0
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Rafał Szelc>And I'll prepare the sales data breakdown for Anna. I'll get that to you by the end of the day.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/20-0
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Perfect. Any other points of discussion before we wrap up?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/21-0
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'm good for now. Thank you, everyone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/22-0
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I'm all set.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/23-0
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Thanks, everyone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/24-0
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Rafał Szelc>See you next time.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/25-0
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Alright, talk to you all soon. Have a great day.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/26-0
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Wait, Adam, one last thing. I wanted to quickly touch on the budget for the new hire we discussed last week.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/27-0
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Sure, Magda. What's the status on that? Have you had a chance to look at the numbers?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/28-0
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Yes, I've run the projections. It looks like we can absorb the cost for a junior role without impacting other departments too much.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/29-0
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Anna Kowalska>That's a relief. We really need that extra help in marketing to push the new campaign.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/30-0
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>And it'll help us manage the workload on the technical side, too. We've been spread pretty thin lately.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/31-0
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>So, we're all in agreement on moving forward with the hire? Magda, can you finalize the budget and send it to HR?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/32-0
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>On it. I'll get that done by the end of the day.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/33-0
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Fantastic. Thanks for bringing that up, Magda. Okay, now we are officially wrapped up. Have a productive week, everyone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/34-0
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Rafał Szelc>You too, Adam.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/35-0
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Bye, everyone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/36-0
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/37-0
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>See ya.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/38-0
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Alright, it looks like everyone has left except for us. I wanted to touch on the new project proposal we received this morning.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/39-0
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Oh, the one from our potential new client, 'Innovate Corp'?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/40-0
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Exactly. It's a massive deal, potentially a game-changer for us.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/41-0
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I saw the initial specs. It's ambitious. We'd have to bring in some external consultants for the AI component.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/42-0
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>External consultants mean significant costs. We need to be realistic about our budget.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/43-0
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've already had a preliminary chat with them. They're willing to negotiate.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/44-0
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.500
<v Anna Kowalska>From a marketing perspective, this would be a huge win for our brand image.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/45-0
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>It would. So, let's schedule a dedicated meeting for this project alone. Everyone read through the proposal in detail.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/46-0
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'll prepare a preliminary budget estimate based on Tomasz's feedback.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/47-0
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>And I'll put together a tech feasibility report.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/48-0
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to work on that. I'll send out the meeting invite later today.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/49-0
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Great. See you all then.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/50-0
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/51-0
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Later.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/52-0
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Ciao.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/53-0
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>And so it begins. Back to the grind.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/54-0
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'm having some issues with the CRM data from last month. A lot of the new leads aren't tagged correctly.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/55-0
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>That's an integration issue. I'll check the API logs. It might be a recent update that broke the sync.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/56-0
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Okay, great. I need to run a report for the upcoming Q4 planning session, so I need it fixed soon.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/57-0
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>I'll prioritize it. I'll let you know when it's resolved. Should be quick.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/58-0
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Thanks, Tomasz.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/59-0
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Let's shift focus to our new product launch. Anna, what's the latest on the marketing campaign for it?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/60-0
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Anna Kowalska>We're in the final stages of content creation. The landing page copy and social media assets are almost ready.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/61-0
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>And the product itself is on track for the planned release date? We still have some final bug fixes to iron out.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/62-0
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>We're looking at a soft launch next week. Tomasz, do you foresee any major delays?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/63-0
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>No, I think we'll be fine. We just need to work a little overtime to get everything polished.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/64-0
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Good. I'm already fielding questions from some of our key clients about it. The demand is there.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/65-0
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>And I'm assuming we'll be tracking the performance closely after launch to justify the investment?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/66-0
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Absolutely, Magda. We'll have a debrief a week after the launch to review the initial numbers.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/67-0
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'll be setting up the analytics dashboards for that right away.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/68-0
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Great. Any final thoughts on the launch before we move on?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/69-0
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'm good.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/70-0
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Me too.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/71-0
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Ready to go.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/72-0
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Excellent. Let's talk about the new intern program...</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/73-0
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I just wanted to follow up on the expense reports for the last sales trip. There are a few receipts missing.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/74-0
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Oh, my apologies. I'll get those to you by the end of the day. They're on my desk.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/75-0
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>No problem at all, Rafał. Just need to close out the books for the quarter.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/76-0
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Thanks for flagging that, Magda. Efficiency is key.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/77-0
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'll make sure to get them to you right after this meeting.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/78-0
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Much appreciated.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/79-0
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I've finished the initial analysis on the competitor's new app. The user interface is quite intuitive.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/80-0
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Anna Kowalska>Is there anything we can learn from their marketing strategy? I've been tracking their social media campaigns.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/81-0
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Rafał Szelc>They're offering a 30-day free trial, which is really impacting our lead generation numbers.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/82-0
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Should we consider a similar offer? Magda, how would that affect our revenue projections?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/83-0
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>It's a short-term hit, but if we have a high conversion rate, it could be a strategic win in the long run.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/84-0
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Anna Kowalska>We can start with a pilot program and track the conversion rates closely.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/85-0
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Okay, Anna, work with Rafał and Magda on the details for that. Let's circle back on this next week.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/86-0
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Will do, Adam.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/87-0
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Sounds good.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/88-0
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I need to discuss the upcoming server maintenance. We need to schedule some downtime.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/89-0
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>When would be the best time for that, Tomasz? We need to minimize the impact on our users.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/90-0
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>I'm proposing a window from 2 AM to 4 AM on a Sunday. It's our lowest traffic period.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/91-0
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'll need to send out an email to all our users to inform them in advance. I'll draft it and send it to you for review, Adam.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/92-0
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Please do. Let's make sure the communication is clear and proactive.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/93-0
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Perfect. I'll send out the maintenance plan to everyone on the team.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/94-0
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'll notify our key account managers as well.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/95-0
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'm good with the plan.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/96-0
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Alright, looks like we're on the same page. Is that everything for today?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/97-0
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Yes, from my side.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/98-0
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Same here.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/99-0
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Nothing else from me.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/100-0
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Great. Thanks for the productive meeting, everyone. Have a good one.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/101-0
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.000
<v Rafał Szelc>You too. Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/102-0
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/103-0
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/104-0
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>See ya.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/105-0
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I've been looking into our social media engagement. It seems our recent posts aren't getting as much traction as they used to.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/106-0
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've noticed that too. We might need to adjust our content strategy. What are your thoughts on that?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/107-0
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'm thinking we should move to more video content. It seems to perform better across all platforms right now.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/108-0
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>Video content requires more resources. I'll need to know what you're thinking so I can allocate development time.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/109-0
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>And it'll impact the budget. I'd need a clear proposal on the cost versus the projected ROI.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/110-0
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Let's table that for a separate discussion. Anna, get a proposal together with Tomasz and Magda, then we can review it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/111-0
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Sounds good. I'll set up a time for us to meet early next week.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/112-0
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Perfect. Back to the original agenda...</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/113-0
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I’ve been speaking with our distribution partners. They're asking for better access to our marketing materials.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/114-0
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I've been working on a portal for that. It's almost ready to go live.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/115-0
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>Let me know when you're ready to test the platform. I can help with security and performance checks.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/116-0
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Good. Once that's live, it should make our partners' jobs a lot easier. Any other updates?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/117-0
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Anna Kowalska>That's all for me.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/118-0
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'm good.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/119-0
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>And me.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/120-0
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Alright, we're making good progress here.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/121-0
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I've been looking at the projections for next year. We need to find areas where we can cut costs to invest more in R&D.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/122-0
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>R&D is crucial for staying competitive. I can't stress that enough.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/123-0
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
<v Rafał Szelc>From a sales perspective, having new, innovative products is a huge advantage.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/124-0
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Anna Kowalska>And it gives marketing something exciting to talk about.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/125-0
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>So, we're all aligned. Magda, can you lead the effort on finding those areas to optimize?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/126-0
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Of course. I'll get back to you with a report next week.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/127-0
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Excellent. Let's make sure we're smart about this. We don't want to cut corners that impact our core business.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/128-0
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Agreed. My focus will be on non-essential expenditures.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/129-0
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I need to confirm the terms with the new vendor we're onboarding. The contract is ready, but I need a final sign-off.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/130-0
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Send it over to me, Rafał. I'll review it this afternoon and get back to you with a signature.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/131-0
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Thanks, Adam. It's a key vendor, so I want to get this done as soon as possible.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/132-0
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>And I need a copy for our records, Rafał. Just for financial tracking.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/133-0
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
<v Rafał Szelc>You got it. I'll send it to both of you.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/134-0
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I've noticed some inconsistencies in our user data. It's making our a/b tests difficult to analyze.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/135-0
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Is it a technical issue, Tomasz, or a data collection problem?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/136-0
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>It's a bit of both. We need to re-evaluate our data schema and standardize it across all platforms.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/137-0
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.500
<v Anna Kowalska>I've been noticing that our marketing reports have some missing metrics. This might be the cause.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/138-0
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>And it's impacting my financial models as well. I'm not getting accurate user conversion data.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/139-0
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>This is a critical issue. Tomasz, can you create a plan to address this and present it to us next week?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/140-0
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>On it. I'll get a proposal and timeline ready.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/141-0
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Excellent. Let's make this a top priority.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/142-0
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've been talking with the support team. They're getting a lot of tickets about a specific bug in our new app.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/143-0
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Oh, I know the one. It's a minor UI issue on mobile devices. I have a fix ready for it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/144-0
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Great. Let's get that patch deployed as soon as possible. No need for a separate meeting on that.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/145-0
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'll prepare a quick update to post on our social channels once the fix is live.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/146-0
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Thanks, Anna. That'll help reduce the support tickets.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/147-0
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'm working on the budget for the annual company offsite. It's coming up soon.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/148-0
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Let’s try to find a more cost-effective location this year. Last year was great, but we overspent.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/149-0
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I have a few options in mind. I'll send over a spreadsheet with the cost breakdowns for each one.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/150-0
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>It would be great if the location had good internet access. We might need to work on some things there.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/151-0
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'll make sure to include that in the notes for each option. Thanks, Tomasz.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/152-0
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
<v Anna Kowalska>The new blog post series is live. I've scheduled posts to go out twice a week to drive organic traffic.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/153-0
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Have we tracked the keyword performance for those posts? That's a key part of our strategy.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/154-0
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Anna Kowalska>Yes, I'm monitoring them daily. So far, the initial results are promising.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/155-0
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I can add some more technical keywords if you need them, Anna. Just let me know.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/156-0
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.500
<v Anna Kowalska>Thanks, Tomasz. I'll take a look at the data and let you know.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/157-0
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've been in contact with that new client, "Global Solutions," and they're looking for a custom solution.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/158-0
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>A custom solution means a lot of work. Tomasz, how would that impact our current roadmap?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/159-0
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>It would require us to pivot some resources. We'd have to put some of our other projects on hold.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/160-0
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.500
<v Magda Zawadzka>And it would be a substantial investment. We'd need a new budget allocation for this project alone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/161-0
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>We need to weigh the pros and cons. Rafał, can you get some more details from them on what exactly they need?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/162-0
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Absolutely. I'll get a detailed requirements document from them this week.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/163-0
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I just wanted to get an update on our vendor contract renewals. A few of them are coming up at the end of the month.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/164-0
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Have you reviewed the terms? Let's make sure we're not paying for services we no longer need.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/165-0
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'm in the process of doing that. I've flagged a few that I think we can renegotiate.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/166-0
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.000
<v Rafał Szelc>That’s great, Magda. Those cost savings can go a long way.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/167-0
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.000
<v Anna Kowalska>And maybe a portion of that can be reallocated to marketing?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/168-0
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'll make a note of it. Let's get the renewals finalized first.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/169-0
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>The server logs are showing a high volume of requests from an unusual IP range. It looks like a potential security threat.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/170-0
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>That's a serious concern. Have you taken any steps to mitigate it, Tomasz?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/171-0
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I've blocked the IP range for now, but I'm running a deeper scan to identify the source of the attack.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/172-0
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.000
<v Rafał Szelc>We need to inform our clients if this affects them. What’s the potential impact?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/173-0
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>No customer data has been compromised yet. It looks like they were just trying to overload the system.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/174-0
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Good. Let's make sure our security protocols are up to date. Tomasz, keep us informed on your progress.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/175-0
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Will do, Adam. I'm on it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/176-0
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've been preparing for the upcoming trade show. I need to know what new product features we can showcase there.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/177-0
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>I can give you a list of new features from the last quarter. We can put together a demo for them.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/178-0
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
<v Anna Kowalska>And I can create some new brochures and a video reel to highlight those features.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/179-0
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Sounds like a good plan. Let’s make a strong impression at that show.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/180-0
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Thanks, guys. That's a huge help.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/181-0
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I've finalized the Q4 budget. We have a small surplus, which I've allocated to the marketing and R&D departments.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/182-0
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>That's great news! We can use that for some of the new tooling we discussed.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/183-0
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500
<v Anna Kowalska>And I can use it to increase our digital ad spend. Thanks, Magda.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/184-0
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>That's great work, Magda. It's good to see we're managing our resources effectively.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/185-0
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Thank you. It was a team effort.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/186-0
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've been hearing some feedback from clients that they want more in-depth training on our product.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/187-0
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.500
<v Anna Kowalska>I've been thinking about creating a series of video tutorials. It would be a great way to showcase our expertise.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/188-0
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I can help with the technical scripts and some of the video production. We have some good tools for that.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/189-0
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>This is an important initiative. Let's make sure we allocate the necessary resources for it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/190-0
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'll be happy to review the budget proposal for that.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/191-0
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I’m working on a new feature for the app that will allow for real-time data analytics. It's a big project.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/192-0
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>That's exactly what our clients are asking for. What’s the timeline looking like, Tomasz?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/193-0
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I'm aiming for a beta release in Q1 next year. It's a significant undertaking, but it'll be worth it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/194-0
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Rafał Szelc>That feature will be a massive selling point. I can already think of a few clients who would be interested in it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/195-0
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Anna Kowalska>And it'll give us a huge advantage over our competitors.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/196-0
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'll start building a financial model around this new feature to track its profitability.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/197-0
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Let's talk about the upcoming employee review cycle. We need to set clear goals for everyone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/198-0
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I'll be working with HR to finalize the performance metrics. They'll be tied to our department's KPIs.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/199-0
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'll make sure my team's goals are aligned with the sales targets we discussed earlier.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/200-0
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>And I'll work with my team on setting clear technical milestones.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/201-0
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I'll be setting goals related to brand awareness and campaign engagement.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/202-0
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Perfect. Let's make sure we're all on the same page. I'll send out the final documents for review next week.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/203-0
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Sounds good, Adam.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/204-0
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'm looking at our Q4 forecast, and it seems like we have a new competitor in the market. They're offering a similar product at a lower price point.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/205-0
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>That's a concern. Anna, how should we respond to this from a marketing standpoint?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/206-0
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
<v Anna Kowalska>We need to highlight our value proposition and superior features. We can't compete on price alone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/207-0
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.500
<v Tomasz Nowak>We have a much more robust platform. I can put together a technical comparison to show our advantages.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/208-0
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>And I can model the impact of their pricing on our market share. We need to be proactive about this.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/209-0
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.500
<v Adam Jakubczak>Good. Let's make this a priority. We can't afford to lose market share.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/210-0
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'll be in touch with all of you on this.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/211-0
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I just wanted to quickly mention the Q3 financial audit is coming up. We need to make sure all our documents are in order.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/212-0
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Thanks for the reminder, Magda. Everyone, please make sure your departmental expenses and reports are up to date.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/213-0
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I've already submitted everything from the sales team. It's all in the system.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/214-0
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Same here. All my marketing expenses have been logged.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/215-0
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>And I'm just finalizing some of the software purchases. I'll have that done by end of day.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/216-0
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Perfect. The smoother the process, the better for all of us.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/217-0
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Let's briefly discuss the client satisfaction survey results from last quarter. Any major surprises?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/218-0
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Rafał Szelc>The scores are generally positive, but a few clients mentioned slow customer support response times.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/219-0
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>That's an area we need to improve. Tomasz, can you look into our support ticket system to see where the bottlenecks are?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/220-0
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>I'll check the analytics on that. It might be a need for more automation.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/221-0
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>And that would reduce our operational costs as well. A win-win.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/222-0
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Exactly. Let's make sure we address that quickly.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/223-00
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Anna Kowalska>We're planning a new social media campaign to promote our new product. I've been working on a content calendar for it.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/224-00
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'll provide you with some testimonials from our recent satisfied clients. They'd be great for social proof.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/225-00
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Anna Kowalska>That's a fantastic idea, Rafał. Thank you.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/226-00
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Alright, is there anything else on the agenda?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/227-00
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I'm good.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/228-00
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Same here.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/229-00
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>Nothing else from my side.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/230-00
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Anna Kowalska>I think we've covered everything.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/231-00
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Great. Thanks for all your hard work, everyone. Let's touch base again next week. Have a productive day.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/232-00
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Rafał Szelc>Bye, everyone.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/233-00
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/234-00
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>See ya.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/235-00
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.000
<v Anna Kowalska>Bye.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/236-00
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>I've been looking into our quarterly goals. It seems like we're on track to hit most of them, but the sales target is still a bit of a stretch.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/237-00
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Rafał Szelc>It's a tough market, but we have some new leads that I'm confident about closing. We'll get there.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/238-00
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Anna Kowalska>We're planning to launch a new targeted ad campaign. I'm hoping that will give sales a boost.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/239-00
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Tomasz Nowak>And I'm working on some performance optimizations on the website. A faster user experience should help with conversions.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/240-00
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Magda Zawadzka>I've accounted for those campaigns in the budget. Let's make sure we track the ROI closely.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/241-00
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>Perfect. It's good to see we're all aligned and working towards the same goals.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/242-00
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Rafał Szelc>I just wanted to quickly mention a new partnership opportunity. I think it could be a game-changer for us.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/243-00
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Adam Jakubczak>What's the nature of the partnership? Is it a collaboration or a distribution deal?</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/244-00
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Rafał Szelc>It's a collaboration. They have a strong presence in a market we've been trying to break into.</v>

5465e9fc-7169-45e5-bb94-c4b07756e2fe/245-00
